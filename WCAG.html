  <h2>The building of my website</h2>
    <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>I have provided alternative texts to my images, so that any person on any browser can get information provided on my site.</p>
	  <p></p>
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
      <p>This site uses Javascript only on the Javascript page, where it is used in the form of buttons and calculations to tell you how long it will take for your character to be leveled, or if you're old enough to drink. Otherwise, there is no Javascript on any other of the pages.</p>
	  <p></p>
    <h3>Links<h3>
      <p>All links on this site open in the same window, so your browser's 'back' button will always work every time. I have checked to make sure that all of the browsers also can access my website with no issues, which they can.</p>
